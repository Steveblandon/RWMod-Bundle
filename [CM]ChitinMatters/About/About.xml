	This is a patch that streamlines and balances out chitin from Alpha Animals and Vanilla Factions Expanded - Insectoids. Load after both of those mods.

	simplifies alpha animals' insect chitin, iron chitin, Hardened chitin, black chitin and VFE-Insectoids' chitin into: chitin, hardened chitin, black chitin, and metallic chitin.

	- chitin is "insect chitin" from alpha animals. All insects drop it by default, including vanilla insects.
	- hardened chitin is a combination of iron chitin and hardened chitin from alpha animals (there wasn't much of a difference between the two). Dropped by blood/razor shrimps from alpha animals, and various tough insectoids from VFE.
	- black chitin is unchanged, just nerfed down a bit.
	- metallic chitin is VFE-insectoid's approach to chitin. It's been nerfed down to be a weaker option to metal.
	- the milk beetle from VFE-insectoid can be "sheared" for chitin (fixed the wording there, VFE-insectoids mod worded it as wool, I word it as "chitin loosening").
	- the iron husk beetle (alpha animals only source and whole purpose for iron chitin) now metallic chitin. Its the only source of metallic chitin.
